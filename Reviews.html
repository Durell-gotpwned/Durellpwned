          <p>“It was apparent to me the first time I met Durell, that he is an exceptional member of both the Beacon Ambassador team and the campus community as a whole. I have had the pleasure of supervising Durell in his role as a Beacon Ambassador on UMass Boston’s campus, a role that Durell exemplifies: being a dedicated ambassador of the University’s mission to create a more diverse and inclusive world.</p>
           <p>Durell’s hard-work, commitment, and welcoming demeanor to his commitments have made him a staple on UMass’s campus, known and well-liked by all.</p>
          <p>I am consistently impressed with the immense effort and organization that Durell maintains in his personal and academic life, balancing a full course load, a campus job, and involvement in the leadership of multiple student organizations. It is these attributes that will continue to take Durell to the very top of every path he pursues.</p>
          <p>Both in his genuine care towards his community and his commitment to the organization he represents, Durell is an excellent candidate that will enthusiastically embrace the opportunity to grow and learn in any opportunity he takes on. I can’t wait to see where the future takes Durell!”</p>

        Dear Employers,
<p>I am writing today to recommend Dave Ndecham. Dave has been a key member of The National Society of
Leadership and Success Chapter (NSLS) at University of Massachusetts Boston and has completed a rigorous
leadership training program through our organization.
<p> many hours of hard work, and after evaluations by both the staff at their college as well as our National
Office, Dave has been awarded the Foundations of Leadership Certification. The NSLS is the nation's largest
leadership honor society, providing over 1 million members with life-changing certification programs, personal
growth, and professional development resources.</p>
<p>In order to achieve induction in the NSLS, Dave committed to attending leadership training focused on
collaborative teamwork, goal setting, high achievement, leadership skills and styles, self-motivation, and
accountability. These exemplary qualities are aligned with employees who are poised for success. Instead of
needing to acquire such skills on the job, Dave will come to your organization with them already developed.
Since joining, Dave has attended training broadcasts with leaders such as former Presidents Barack Obama and
George W. Bush, Mark Cuban, Barbara Corcoran, Trevor Noah, Deepak Chopra, Sir Richard Branson, and
Arianna Huffington. Additionally, through bi-weekly networking team meetings, Dave has learned how to engage
a peer group to increase performance while completing a journal to document progress and goals.</p>

<p>Members, such as Dave Ndecham, who complete our leadership program have proven to be well prepared for the
next step in their professional journey.</p>
<p>Very truly yours,</p>
<p>Neil Khaund</p>
<p>President and CEO</p>
<p>The National Society of Leadership and Success</p>
</p></I>
